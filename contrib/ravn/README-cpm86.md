## CP/M-86 vs MS-DOS — same 8086 core, different runtime + exe format

For the compiler, **CP/M-86 codegen *is* MS-DOS 8086 codegen** — same 8086
real-mode instruction set, same OMF `.obj` format, same memory models
(tiny/small/compact/large ↔ 8080/Small/Compact/Big group models), same
calling conventions. CP/M-86 sources are compiled `wcc -bt=dos`; the
compiler never needs to know the target. Only **two** things differ, and
both are link/runtime concerns, not codegen:

1. **Runtime / OS-call mechanism.** MS-DOS enters the OS with `INT 21h`
   (function in `AH`); CP/M-86 uses reserved software `INT 224` (`0E0h`)
   into the BDOS (function in `CL`; 8086 `CH:CL` mirror CP/M-80 `B:C`). The
   C-runtime seam that bridges Watcom's DOS clib onto BDOS lives in
   `watcom-cpm86-libc/port/` and `bld/clib/_cpm/`. Ref: *CP/M-86 System
   Guide* §4.1 (the txt's OCR "#244" is a typo for the assembler's
   `equ 224 ;reserved BDOS Interrupt`).
2. **Executable format.** MS-DOS uses flat `.COM` (≤64K) or relocatable MZ
   `.EXE`; CP/M-86 uses `.CMD` — a 128-byte header of up to 8 nine-byte
   **group descriptors** (code/data/extra/stack + 4 aux; each a paragraph
   length + optional absolute base) that the CCP/loader uses to place the
   groups and set CS/DS/SS/ES. Ref: *CP/M-86 System Guide* §3 (GENCMD/CMD
   header) & §4 (memory models). Realized here by native
   `wlink format cpm86` (see below), not a wrapper.

**Distinguishing the two in source — `__CPM86__`.** `-bt=cpm86` is a
**first-class compiler build target**. Verified empirically: `-bt=dos`
predefines `__DOS__`/`_DOS`/`MSDOS`; `-bt=cpm86` predefines `__CPM86__`
**and** `__DOS__`/`_DOS`/`MSDOS`. Use `#ifdef __CPM86__` to select CP/M-86
code paths; the DOS-family macros keep every DOS-gated header/clib applying
unchanged. Implementation is a zero-codegen-impact two-liner in
`bld/cc/c/cmdlnx86.c` (`setTargetSystem` maps `"CPM86"` → `TS_DOS` — nothing
branches on `TS_DOS` vs the old `TS_OTHER` default except the `_DOS`/`MSDOS`
predefines; `SetFinalTargetSystem` adds `__DOS__`; both `#if _CPU == 8086`).
The `owcc -bcpm86` driver already passes `-bt=cpm86` (via
`bld/wcl/owcc/*/specs.owc`), so the shipping build gets all four macros. (The
`_cpm` clib variant is still *built* with `-bt=dos` per `flags.mif` — fine,
identical codegen, and clib needs no `__CPM86__`.)

Primary references are the manuals in this directory
(`CPM-86_System_Guide_Jun83`, `CPM-86_Programmers_Guide_Jan83`,
`Concurrent_CPM_Programmers_Reference_Guide_Jan84`). See also the
superproject memo `tasks/memory/reference_cpm86_vs_msdos_model.md`.

## Short answer — native `format cpm86` (patched into this fork)

`wl` in this tree emits CP/M-86 `.CMD` files directly. Link with:

```
wcc  -bt=dos -0 -ms -zl -zastd=c99 hello.c -fo=hello.obj
wl   format cpm86 op dosseg op quiet name HELLO.CMD file hello.obj  [more files/libraries]
```

Sub-formats: `format cpm86 small` (separate code/data groups, pair with `-ms`)
and `format cpm86 8080` (single group, `.COM`-like). A `library cpm86 …`
(`LIBCPM86`) directive is also recognised.

**Proof it is native, not a wrapper** (cite these, do not re-derive):

- `bld/wl/h/_formats.h` — `pick_format( 0x00200000, MK_CPM86, 21, "CP/M-86", "CP/M-86" )`.
- `bld/wl/c/cmdcpm86.c` / `bld/wl/h/cmdcpm86.h` — the `CPM86` format command,
  its `SMall`/`8080` sub-formats and `SetCPM86Fmt`/`FreeCPM86Fmt`, gated on `_CPM86`.
- `bld/wl/c/loadcpm86.c` / `bld/wl/h/loadcpm86.h` — the actual `.CMD` image
  writer (`WriteCPM86Data`, group-descriptor header).
- `bld/wl/c/cmdline.c` wires `MK_CPM86` + `"LIBCPM86"`; `bld/wl/c/cmdall.c`
  registers the `"CPM86"` format keyword.
- Built objects present: `bld/wl/osxa64/loadcpm86.obj`, `…/cmdcpm86.obj`. The
  four benchmark `.CMD`s in the comparison harness and every `.cmd` under
  `watcom-cpm86-libc/build-*/` were produced by this native `format cpm86` and
  run correctly under `cpm86run_unicorn.py`.

The remaining task for a *standard* C program is the CP/M-86 **C runtime**
(there is no `__CPM__`-targeted `clib` build): that seam layer — a CP/M-86
`crt0`, a BDOS-based stdio/`printf`, an arena heap and small stubs — is provided
in `watcom-cpm86-libc/port/` and linked alongside Watcom's own (unchanged) clib
objects. See `watcom-cpm86-libc/README.md`.

## Retired: freestanding raw binary + `bin2cmd.py` (removed 2026-08-19)

Before the native `format cpm86` patch, CP/M-86 `.CMD`s were produced by
emitting a flat `format raw` image and wrapping it in a 128-byte `.CMD` header
with a hand-written `bin2cmd.py`, driven by `build-cpm86.sh`. Both files have
been **removed** now that `owcc -bcpm86` / `wl format cpm86` emit `.CMD`
directly — the linker is the single source of truth for the header, so there is
no longer a second (hand-rolled) header writer to keep in sync.

The freestanding example sources (`hello.asm`, `hello.c`, `echoarg.asm`,
`dhry.c`, `bigdata.c`, `cpmstart.asm`) and their prebuilt `.CMD` artifacts are
kept as runnable references for the raw-BDOS (`INT 0E0h`) technique; rebuild
them with the native linker path (`owcc -bcpm86 …` or `wl format cpm86 …`).

### The `.CMD` header

CP/M-86 executables start with a 128-byte **Command File Header**: eight 9-byte
group descriptors (`type, length, base, min, max`, little-endian, in 16-byte
paragraphs), followed by RSX/fixup/flags fields. Verified against Digital
Research's *CP/M-86 System Guide* (Command File Format appendix) and the
seasip.info archive. The linker's writer lives in `bld/wl/c/loadcpm86.c`
(+ `cmdcpm86.c`); the Unicorn runner (`cpm86run_unicorn.py`) carries a small
read-only `parse_header()` to inspect the descriptors when loading.

### The system-call layer (`hello.asm` / `hello.c`)

With no C runtime, the program calls **BDOS directly via `INT 0E0h`**
(`CL`=function, `DX`=parameter). Functions used: 9 (print `$`-terminated
string at `DS:DX`) and 0 (terminate).

**Entry & segment convention (per the DR System Guide, Section 2.3–2.5).** The
loader picks the memory model from the `.CMD` group descriptors and initialises
the segment registers and entry `IP` accordingly:

| Model | Groups | CS/DS/ES | Entry IP |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| 8080  | code only | CS=DS=ES=code base | **`0100H`** |
| Small | code + data | CS=code, DS=ES=data | `0000H` |

In the **8080 model** the first `100H` bytes of the (shared) code group are the
**base page**, and execution begins at **`CS:0100H`** — exactly like CP/M-80's
`.COM`. (An earlier version of this note incorrectly said `CS:0000`; only the
Small/Compact models enter at offset 0.) The base page lives at `DS:0000`. The
entry code **forces `DS = CS`** (`push cs` / `pop ds`) so the `$`-string, which
lives in the same group, is addressable regardless of how the loader set `DS`.

- `hello.asm` (wasm) is the recommended starting point: code is assembled at
  `org 100h` (after the base page) and the loader enters there.
- `hello.c` shows the same thing in C via a `#pragma aux` BDOS call, for once a
  C runtime is added later.

### Command line, FCB and base page setup

Before entering a program the emulated CCP (`ccp.py`) populates the base page
from the typed command line, just like real CP/M-86 (System Guide 2.6/2.7):

- the two filename arguments are parsed into the **default FCBs** at `DS:005CH`
  and `DS:006CH` (drive code, 8.3 name, wildcards);
- the **command tail** is stored at `DS:0080H` (length byte + upper-cased
  characters), which is also the default DMA buffer;
- the group length/base descriptors and the `M80` flag (offset `05H`) are
  filled in from the header.

`ECHOARG.CMD` demonstrates this — it prints the command tail the CCP left at
`0080H`:

```
python3 cpm86run_unicorn.py ECHOARG.CMD one two.dat   ->   " ONE TWO.DAT"
```

### Ready-to-run artifact: `HELLO.CMD`

`HELLO.CMD` in this folder is a **complete, runnable** CP/M-86 executable. It is
byte-identical to the earlier hand-assembled reference, which validated the hand
analysis of the header format. Rebuild it via the native linker path
(`owcc -bcpm86` / `wl format cpm86`). Code layout (after the base page):

```
0100: 0e 1f ba 0d 01 b1 09 cd e0       ; push cs; pop ds; mov dx,msg; mov cl,9; int E0h
      b1 00 cd e0                       ; mov cl,0; int E0h
010d: "Hello, CP/M-86 from Open Watcom!\r\n$"
```

## Building the toolchain

Open Watcom does not need a full release build to compile CP/M-86 programs: the
**bootstrap** cross-tools are enough. On this arm64 macOS host the toolchain was
built with the CI bootstrap path (native `clang`):

```
export OWROOT=$(pwd) OWTOOLS=CLANG OWOBJDIR=binbuild OWBUILD_STAGE=boot
. ./cmnvars.sh
cd bld && sh $OWROOT/ci/buildx.sh          # builds wmake, builder, then `builder boot`
```

This populates `build/binbuild/` with the bootstrap cross-compilers/-assembler/
-linker: `bwcc` (16-bit C), `bwasm` (assembler) and `bwlink` (linker). Put that
directory on `PATH` and `build-cpm86.sh` uses those automatically (it prefers a
released `wasm`/`wcc`/`wl` if present, else falls back to `bwasm`/`bwcc`/
`bwlink`).

## What is still required

1. **A CP/M-86 C runtime** for the standard C library (stdio, malloc,
   `printf`). This **now exists** in `watcom-cpm86-libc/` — a CP/M-86 startup
   stub plus a BDOS-based shim replacing clib's INT 21h calls — and is what the
   compiler-quality benchmarks link against. Freestanding code (own BDOS calls,
   as in `hello.c`) needs none of this.
2. **Validation on real CP/M-86.** The `.CMD` runs under the included
   instruction-level emulators (see below); a full-machine emulator (86Box,
   PCem, or a CP/M-86 VM) is still the way to validate OS-loader specifics.

## Emulation / testing

Two included runners execute the actual machine code at instruction level:

- `cpm86run.py` — a small hand-written 8086 interpreter with a BDOS hook.
- `cpm86run_unicorn.py` — uses **Unicorn Engine** (QEMU's CPU core), so the
  8086/80186+ instructions are decoded by independent, well-tested code; only
  the CP/M-86 BDOS layer is emulated here.

Both print `Hello, CP/M-86 from Open Watcom!` for `HELLO.CMD`.

### Non-trivial program: Dhrystone 2.1

`dhry.c` is a faithful port of Reinhold Weicker's **Dhrystone 2.1** benchmark
(structs, unions, enums, pointer chasing, record assignment, string handling
and many cross-function calls) made freestanding for CP/M-86: `printf`/`scanf`
are replaced by BDOS console output and a fixed run count, `malloc` by a static
pool, and `strcpy`/`strcmp` are provided locally. Build and run it with the
same pipeline:

```
export PATH=$OWROOT/build/binbuild:$PATH
./build-cpm86.sh dhry.c
python3 cpm86run_unicorn.py DHRY.CMD
```

It prints the benchmark's documented final values and every one matches its
`should be:` line (`Int_Glob 5`, `Bool_Glob 1`, `Arr_2_Glob[8][7] == runs+10`,
the record fields, the strings, …) — i.e. the 16-bit code the bootstrapped
`wcc` generated executes **correctly**. Timing is intentionally omitted: an
instruction-level emulator has no meaningful wall clock, so the benchmark is
used here as a correctness stress test, not a MIPS figure.

If you do want a *host-independent* work metric, pass `--count` to the runner
and it reports the exact number of instructions executed:

```
python3 cpm86run_unicorn.py --count DHRY.CMD
    ...
    [14946252 instructions executed]     # ~747 instructions per Dhrystone run
```

That tally is deterministic (it depends only on the generated code and the
emulator, not on the host). It is *not* a Dhrystones/second score — deriving
one would require multiplying by 8086 cycle counts (≈15–30 cyc/insn), which for
14.9M instructions over 20000 runs works out to roughly 300–500 Dhrystones/sec
on a 5–8 MHz 8086, in line with period measurements. Those are estimates; only
the instruction count is actually measured.

Because a C program has many functions and `wl format raw` does not reorder
`_TEXT` to put the entry symbol first, the C path links a tiny startup stub
(`cpmstart.asm`) **first**; its first byte is the entry point and it calls the
C entry `cpmmain()`.

### Large program with more than 64 KB of data: `bigdata.c`

`bigdata.c` is a bigger program (a PRNG, a table-driven CRC-32, three more
checksum routines, record generation, a cross-segment ring traversal and
hex/decimal printers) that builds and checksums a **data structure larger than
64 KB**. The program image itself stays inside one ≤64 KB CP/M-86 group, but
the data structure — 3072 records × 64 bytes = **192 KB**, three 64 KB
segments — lives *above* the program in the 1 MB real-mode address space and is
reached through explicit `__far` pointers. This is exactly how CP/M-86 lets a
program use far more than 64 KB of data: the program manages its own segment
registers (here via far pointers) to address the whole memory space (System
Guide §2.5). No linker/model change is needed — small model plus `__far` is
enough, and the emulator already maps the full 1 MB and does real segment
arithmetic.

```
./build-cpm86.sh bigdata.c
python3 cpm86run_unicorn.py BIGDATA.CMD
    ...
    sum32      = 01730B21
    crc32      = 2CA68199
    fletcher   = C3BF0B21
    ring-walk  = 0047FA00
    expected   = 0047FA00  [MATCH]
```

Everything is deterministic (fixed PRNG seed) and independently verified: the
`crc32` value matches Python's `binascii.crc32` over the same 192 KB, and the
`ring-walk` — which follows a `next` index that jumps across all three segments
in a single Hamiltonian ring — equals `N*(N-1)/2`, proving non-sequential far
pointer chasing across segment boundaries works. To avoid pulling in C runtime
helpers (this is a `-zl` freestanding image) the code uses only 16-bit
multiply/divide and 32-bit add/shift/xor — no 32-bit `mul`/`div`.

**Scope — what "run a full program" needs:** Unicorn supplies the CPU; *we*
supply the OS. `cpm86run_unicorn.py` implements the BDOS console/string group
(functions 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11) and feeds console input via
`run(path, stdin_bytes=...)`. It loads the program into a single group with
`CS = DS = ES = SS` and a full-segment stack (the CP/M-86 8080 model), which is
required for real C code that passes the address of a stack local as a
small-model *near* pointer. Disk/file functions (open/close/read/write,
15/16/20/21/…) are **not** implemented yet and raise `BdosUnimplemented` so an
unsupported program fails loudly. Note the instruction set (incl. 80186 via
`CPU=1`) is fully covered by Unicorn/QEMU; the remaining work to test "full"
programs is BDOS coverage, not CPU emulation.

## Linking against the real Digital Research C run-time

The freestanding demos above supply their own BDOS shims. Two sibling
directories go further and link against the **genuine DR C libc**
(`clears.l86`) with DR's own **LINK-86**, so ordinary C (`printf`, `malloc`,
`scanf`, `strcpy`, …) works:

- **`owc-drc/`** — the **modern Open Watcom** compiler producing objects that
  link against the DR C run-time (OMF ↔ `.L86`, no format conversion). See
  `owc-drc/README.md`.
- **`pure-drc/`** — the **genuine DR C v1.11** compiler (1984) and LINK-86,
  no Watcom at all. `pure-drc/build-pure-drc.sh` builds `sample` and Dhrystone
  2.1 and runs each in **both** emulators (emu2 and `cpm86run_unicorn.py`) with
  byte-identical output. See `pure-drc/README.md`.

Getting pure DR C programs to run under `cpm86run_unicorn.py` required the
runner to set up the base page like the real CCP: DR C's startup `m.init`
initialises the small-model stack pointer from the base-page data-length field
`LD` (offset `06H`), so the runner now sizes `LD` from the data group's `G_MAX`
allocation (a full 64 KB) rather than the data-image size — otherwise `SP`
lands on the heap and the program crashes. It also answers the disk-system
BDOS calls `DRV_ALLRESET`/`DRV_SET`/`DRV_GET` (13/14/25) as drive-A: no-ops.

## Running under a real CP/M-86 (full-machine emulators)

The bundled `cpm86run_unicorn.py` is an *instruction-level* harness: great for
fast, deterministic tests, but it has no real OS, no disk and no clock. To run
the programs under a **genuine Digital Research CP/M-86**, use a full-machine
emulator and boot a real CP/M-86 disk. This works because our programs use the
real CP/M-86 ABI — they call the BDOS through `INT 0E0h` (software interrupt
224) with the standard function numbers — so the console demos run unmodified.

Recommended emulators (in order):

1. **86Box** — the most hardware-accurate, actively maintained PC emulator
   (8086/8088/80186/80286…), with native macOS/arm64 builds. Emulates a real
   IBM PC/XT/AT; boot DR CP/M-86 and mount an image built below.
2. **QEMU** (`qemu-system-i386`) — lighter and scriptable, good for CI/
   automation; boots a CP/M-86-for-the-IBM-PC image on emulated PC hardware.
3. **MAME** — cycle-accurate IBM PC 5150 (real 8088 timing). Heavier, but the
   only option that yields a *real* Dhrystones/sec figure (see the timing note
   above) since it models true 8086 cycle timing.

Getting the OS: Digital Research CP/M-86 is now freely redistributable and its
IBM-PC disk images are available from the CP/M preservation sites
(e.g. `www.cpm.z80.de`).

Transferring the `.CMD` files onto a CP/M-86 disk image is automated with
`mkdisk-cpm86.sh` (needs [cpmtools](http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/):
`brew install cpmtools` / `apt-get install cpmtools`):

```
./mkdisk-cpm86.sh cpm86.img          # packs every *.CMD into an IBM CP/M-86 image
    Wrote cpm86.img (ibmpc-514ds):
    0:
    bigdata.cmd  dhry.cmd  echoarg.cmd  hello.cmd
```

Then mount `cpm86.img` as a drive in the emulator and run e.g. `HELLO` or
`DHRY`. The `.CMD` files round-trip through the image byte-identically, and the
image is padded to the drive's full geometry so a full-machine emulator accepts
it.

### RC759 "Piccoline" / Concurrent CP/M-86

The Regnecentralen **RC759 Piccoline** is an **80186** machine running
**Concurrent CP/M-86** — an ideal real target, and its dedicated emulator is
**PCE** by Hampa Hug (see `https://rc700.dk/emulator.php`, which also links a
browser-based build); MAME has an `rc759` driver too, though it is still marked
non-working as of 2026. Concurrent CP/M-86 is a BDOS-compatible superset, so our
`INT 0E0h` console programs run unmodified — and, unlike plain CP/M-86 1.x, it
*does* provide date/time (BDOS 104/105).

Build for the 80186 (`CPU=1`) and pack an RC759-format image:

```
CPU=1 ./build-cpm86.sh dhry.c
FORMAT=rc75x ./mkdisk-cpm86.sh rc759.img HELLO.CMD DHRY.CMD
```

`rc75x` is the RC759 geometry (77 cyl × 2 heads × 8 × 1024-byte sectors); the
script pads the image to the full 1,261,568 bytes. PCE's floppy format is
`.pbit`, so convert the raw image with the `pfdc`/`pbit` tools bundled with PCE
(the script prints the exact commands):

```
pfdc -r 0-76 0-1 1-8 -p new -e size 1024 -e mfm-hd 1 -p load rc759.img -o rc759.pfdc
pbit -p encode mfm-hd-360 rc759.pfdc -o rc759.pbit
```

then, in the emulator monitor, `-m fdc.insert 0:rc759.pbit`.

**Portability caveat:** `HELLO`, `ECHOARG` and `DHRY` use only standard BDOS
console calls and run unmodified on real CP/M-86. `BIGDATA` addresses a
*hard-coded* far segment (`0x3000`) that it does not own — fine under the bare
bundled emulator, but on a real CP/M-86 a program must obtain memory legally
(Concurrent CP/M-86 memory calls 55–58, or the free-memory info in the base
page) before using segments outside its load image. So treat `BIGDATA` as an
emulator demo, not a portable CP/M-86 program.
