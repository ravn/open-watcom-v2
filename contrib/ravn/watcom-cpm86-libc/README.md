# watcom-cpm86-libc — retargeting Open Watcom's own C library to CP/M-86

Tracking issue: **ravn/rc7xx-work#6**.
For the porting *story* (the pivot, milestones, and verification method) see
[`PORTING.md`](PORTING.md); for remaining gaps see [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

**Status:** foundation **proven end-to-end** (run-verified under emu2). This
directory demonstrates that Open Watcom's *own* clib can be retargeted to
CP/M-86 (Intel 8086/80186, e.g. RC759) by supplying only a **thin BDOS
low-level seam** — no DR C bridge, no Aztec C recompile.

Run `./build.sh` — it compiles everything from the scratch OW build tree,
links a CP/M-86 `.CMD`, checks the image is DOS-free, runs it under emu2, and
gates the output against an independent oracle. Expected tail:

```
purity: INT21h(DOS)=0  INTE0h(BDOS)=3
PASS: matches independent oracle (123456*789=97406784 via __I4M)
```

Then run `./build-heap.sh` to prove Watcom's **genuine near-heap** (`malloc`/
`free`/`calloc`/`realloc`) + `qsort` on CP/M-86, resolved only by the arena
`__brk`/`sbrk` seam. Expected tail:

```
purity: INT21h(DOS)=0  INTE0h(BDOS)=3
PASS: Watcom near-heap (malloc/free/calloc/realloc) + qsort on CP/M-86
```

## Why this exists (the pivot)

Earlier work tried two other routes to a CP/M-86 libc: (a) bridge to the
proprietary **DR C** runtime (`owc-drc/`, works but non-free + a float-ABI
seam), and (b) **recompile Aztec C** stdlib source (ABI mismatch vs Watcom's
`long`/`double`, plus Manx-syntax asm for `str*`/`mem*`). Both are dead ends
for a clean, self-owned, single-toolchain libc.

The insight that unlocked this: **Watcom's clib is explicitly layered and
retargetable.** The high-level formatter/`stdio` code is OS-agnostic; only a
handful of *low-level primitives* (`read`/`write`/`open`/`close`/`lseek`/
`sbrk`) carry the OS trap. For 16-bit DOS those live in a single file
(`bld/clib/_dos/a/io086.asm`, `mov ah,40h; int 21h`). A CP/M-86 port =
reuse everything above and swap that thin bottom for BDOS (INT E0h).

## Architecture (three layers)

```
  printf / __prtf / itoa / str* / long+float math   <- Layer 1: Watcom clib,
                                                        REUSED UNCHANGED
  ------------------------------------------------
  cprintf.c  : __prtf(...) + output callback         <- Layer 2: thin CP/M-86
  crt0sm.asm : startup, SS setup, BDOS exit             seam WE own
  ------------------------------------------------
  BDOS console C_WRITE (INT E0h, CL=2)               <- Layer 3: CP/M-86 OS
```

`__prtf(dest, fmt, args, callback)` is Watcom's pure formatter core
(`bld/clib/streamio/c/prtf.c`) — verified to contain **0× INT 21h**. It emits
each formatted character through a caller-supplied callback. `port/cprintf.c`
supplies a callback that writes to the CP/M-86 console via BDOS. That one
function is the entire retarget seam for console output.

The 32-bit `long` path (`%ld`) is handled by Watcom's own compiler-helper
runtime `__I4M`/`__U4M`/`__I4D`/`__U4D` (`bld/clib/cgsupp/a/i4m.asm`,
`i4d.asm`) — assembled unchanged. This is the "Watcom kernel for int and
double/float we keep" the project wants; only the OS seam is ours.

## What the demo proves

`test/main.c` prints `%s %d %ld` (with `123456L*789L = 97406784`, exercising
`__I4M`), then `%x`, width `[%5d][%-5d]`, and `%c`. A byte-exact match to a
hand-computed / host-`printf` oracle proves the full path: **Watcom formatter +
Watcom long-helpers + BDOS callback**, linked by our paragraph-packing-fixed
`wlink`, running on CP/M-86.

Note (16-bit gotcha): in this `-ms` (16-bit `int`) target, a decimal literal
that exceeds `INT_MAX` (e.g. `40000`) is a **`long`**, so it must be printed
with `%lu`/`%ld` (or cast), never `%u`/`%d`. That is standard C vararg width
matching, not a library bug — the formatter itself was verified correct for
`%x`/`%u` in isolation.

## What the heap proof adds (`build-heap.sh`)

`test/heaptest.c` exercises Watcom's **genuine near-heap** — `malloc`, `free`,
`calloc`, `realloc` (plus `qsort`) — resolved *only* by the thin `lowlevel.c`
seam. It sorts a fixed permutation to `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, checks `calloc`
zeroes, grows a block with `realloc` preserving its prefix, and re-`malloc`s
after `free`. A byte-exact match to the hand-computed oracle (in the script),
with **zero INT 21h** in the image, proves the retarget's central claim:
Watcom's whole near-heap manager runs on CP/M-86 with only its bottom
primitive swapped.

The swap is one function. Watcom's DOS heap grows DGROUP via `sbrk.c`'s `__brk`,
whose *only* OS act is `INT 21h AH=4Ah` (`TinySetBlock`, resize the program's
block). `lowlevel.c` replaces `__brk`/`sbrk` with a pure in-DGROUP bump over a
static `_BSS` arena and defines the `_curbrk` RT-data word `grownear.c` reads —
no OS call, because a CP/M-86 `.CMD` already owns its whole TPA. Every heap
manager above `__brk` (`nmalloc`/`nfree`/`calloc`/`nrealloc`/`grownear`/`mem`…)
is Watcom's unmodified clib.

## What the stdio proof adds (`build-stdio.sh`)

`test/stdiotest.c` drives Watcom's **genuine `stdio` FILE\* write-path** —
`printf`, `fprintf`, `puts`, `fputs` — end to end on CP/M-86. This is the real
buffered `FILE` machinery, not the direct-`__prtf` console shortcut: each call
runs `__fprtf`/`fputc` into a `malloc`'d `FILE` buffer, then `__flush` →
`__qwrite`. A byte-exact match to the oracle (`printf 42 ok` / `puts line` /
`fputs line` / `fprintf 97406784`) with **zero INT 21h** proves the whole
`stdio` upper layer is OS-agnostic.

Only two thin seams make it run, both in `port/stdioshim.c`:

- **`__qwrite`** — the single low-level write `__flush` calls (DOS bottoms it
  out in `TinyWrite` → `INT 21h AH=40h`). Ours writes console handles 1/2 via
  BDOS `C_WRITE` (`INT E0h`, `CL=2`), bytes verbatim — Watcom's text-mode
  `fputc` has already turned `\n` into `\r\n` in the buffer.
- **`isatty`** — `__ioalloc`→`__chktty` calls it to pick a buffering mode (DOS
  bottoms out in `INT 21h AH=44h` IOCTL). Ours reports the three standard
  handles as a tty, which also line-buffers `stdout`.

The `FILE` buffer itself comes from the near-heap proof above (each `FILE`'s
`__stream_link` and buffer are `malloc`'d). `__InitFiles` — Watcom's own, and
genuinely DOS-free (it only calls the arena `malloc` to attach a `__stream_link`
to each std `FILE`) — is now run automatically from `crt0` via `__CommonInit`
(`port/cominit.c`), so programs no longer have to call it by hand (**ow#16**;
before, a forgotten `__InitFiles` left `printf` silently emitting nothing). A
fuller crt0 would instead walk the `XI` init table via `__InitRtns` (see
`tasks/memory/reference_watcom_cpm86_startup_initfini.md`).

## What the disk proof adds (`build-diskio.sh`)

`test/disktest.c` lifts the console-only write seam to a full **disk `FILE\*`
path**: Watcom's genuine, unchanged `fopen`/`fclose`/`fwrite`/`fputs`/`fprintf`/
`fread`/`fgets`/`fgetc`/`fseek`/`ftell`/`remove` run against **real CP/M-86 disk
files**. It write-creates `TEST.TXT`, reads it back line-by-line, seeks by an
`ftell`-captured offset, appends, re-counts, seeks absolute in a 256-byte binary
file, checks byte-exact `SEEK_END` on a non-record-aligned binary write, and
`remove`s it — 511 self-checking `VERIFY`s, `DISKIO: PASS`, **zero INT 21h**.

**MAME-verified (2026-08-15).** The same `disktest.cmd` runs on the **real
RC759 under MAME**, which boots **Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1** — the authoritative
oracle (emu2 is only a smoke test, and is explicitly not authoritative for the
CP/M-3 exact-length semantics). All **511 checks pass on the metal**: the guest
streams its result record (tag `0xD15C`, full 16-bit test count, failures, end
sentinel) on the undecoded I/O port `0x2FE` via `mame_out()`, and
`mame-tests/disk_done.lua` reads it back (`DISK-DONE tests=511 failures=0`) and
snapshots the on-screen `DISKIO: PASS (511 tests, 0 failures)` line. Harness:
`mame-tests/disk-mame.sh`.

One seam, `port/diskio.c`, supersedes `stdioshim.c` in this build (it owns the
same console `__qwrite`/`isatty`) and adds the five low-level primitives `fopen`
bottoms out into — `_sopen` / `__qread` / `__qwrite` / `__lseek` / `__close` —
plus `lseek`/`_tell`/`remove`/`unlink`, all backed by CP/M-86 **FCB random-record
BDOS** calls (`INT E0h`):

- **The record model does the hard work.** CP/M has no byte-granular length —
  storage is 128-byte records — so we use `READ RANDOM` (fn 33) / `WRITE RANDOM`
  (fn 34): byte position is just `record = pos>>7`, `offset = pos&127`. An
  unwritten record reads back as EOF, so we fill the work buffer with `Ctrl-Z`
  (0x1A); a partially-written last record keeps a `Ctrl-Z` tail on disk — exactly
  CP/M's text-EOF convention, for free. Text-mode read stops at the first
  `Ctrl-Z`; binary does not.
- **Byte-exact length is tracked locally.** CP/M's directory knows length only
  to the nearest 128-byte record, so each open handle keeps the true length in
  `fp->len` (seeded at open, extended by every write). `SEEK_END`/`ftell` are
  therefore byte-exact for the whole life of an open handle on any CP/M —
  including a 200-byte binary write reporting 200, not 256. A binary file
  reopened read-only can only recover an exact length where the OS persisted
  one (CCP/M-86 / CP/M 3+ LRBC, runtime-detected via BDOS fn 12); on plain
  CP/M-86 it rounds to a record. That reopen limitation and its
  MAME-verification gap are on [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
- **`lseek`/`_tell` route straight to `__lseek`.** The stock POSIX wrappers drag
  in the whole per-handle iomode table (`__GetIOMode`/`__handle_check`/`__NFiles`)
  this minimal seam deliberately omits, so `diskio.c` provides its own thin ones.
- `'\n'`↔`"\r\n"` translation stays **above** the seam in Watcom's text-mode
  `fgetc`/`fputc`, so `__qread`/`__qwrite` move raw bytes — same boundary as the
  console seam.

Watcom ships its own self-checking stream-I/O regression tests
(`bld/clibtest/streamio/c/iotest.c`, `handleio`, `file`) — the eventual
gold-standard oracle, as `float01–04` were for soft-float. They each need a few
more seam primitives than a v1 round-trip (`tmpfile`/`tmpnam`/`fscanf`/
`fopen("CON")`, or `chsize`/`dup`/`filelength`, or `rename`/`access`/`stat`), so
`disktest.c` is the focused v1 gate and those are the documented next step
(the full gap list is in [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)).

## What the stdcbench proof adds (`build-stdcbench.sh`)

The three proofs above each exercise one library subsystem with a toy driver.
**stdcbench 0.8** is the opposite: a substantial, multi-module benchmark that
leans on the *whole* library at once — `printf`/`sprintf`, the `string` and
`ctype` families, `malloc`/`free`/`realloc`, `qsort`, and the 32-bit long
helpers. `build-stdcbench.sh` compiles the **byte-identical upstream stdcbench
sources** (the same tree `owc-drc/stdcbench` built on the DR C runtime) and
links them against Open Watcom's **own, unchanged clib** plus our thin CP/M-86
seams — no Digital Research C runtime, no `clears.l86`. Only `test/scbport.c`
(the stdcbench glue: a BDOS `T_GET` clock and `main`) is ours.

**Two run-verified results:**

- **Functional (emu2):** the whole benchmark runs end to end — every module
  executes and both scores compute correctly through the retargeted clib. emu2's
  clock is the host wall clock, so *that* score reflects the Mac's speed, not the
  RC759; the emu2 run proves execution, not performance.
- **Comparable (MAME rc759):** the SAME `SCB.CMD`, built with `-DMAME_DONE`
  (`run-stdcbench-mame.sh`), on the cycle-accurate MAME rc759 (Concurrent
  CP/M-86 3.1, PICCOLINE XIOS 2.3) scores **c90base 12 · c90lib 8 · final 20**
  (Watcom full optimisation `-otexan`), versus the Digital Research C reference
  **8 · 5 · 13** on the identical machine — the retargeted Watcom clib is
  ~1.5× faster than the ~1984 DR C runtime on both the integer and the
  library-heavy modules, an independent correctness + performance cross-check.

The clock differs from the DR C port on purpose: DR C read BDOS `T_SECONDS`
(fn 155), which emu2 does not implement (so it would spin forever there); we read
`T_GET` (fn 105), which both emu2 (host clock) and the RC759 XIOS maintain, so
the same binary times on both. stdcbench's `c90base`/`c90lib` are integer +
standard-library work only (the `c90float`/`c90double` modules are upstream
stubs in 0.8), so this proof exercises **no floating point** — it neither uses
nor retires the `double` ABI seam.

## What the C++ proof adds (`build-cpp.sh`)

The proofs above are all C. `build-cpp.sh` lifts the same retargeted-clib
foundation to **C++**: Watcom's own **iostreams** (`std::cout`/`cin`/`cerr`,
insertion/extraction operators, `std::endl`), **exception handling**
(`try`/`throw`/`catch`, stack unwinding) and **`setjmp`/`longjmp`** running on
the real RC759, layered over the disk FILE\* seam (`port/diskio.c`) — so
`cout` buffers flush through the same `__qwrite` path the C `stdio` proof uses.
It reuses Watcom's genuine C++ runtime libraries (`plib*`/`plbx*` base runtime
+ `iost*`/`iosx*` iostream) unchanged; only a handful of CP/M-86 OS seams and a
C++-aware startup are ours.

**MAME rc759-verified.** `test/cppfeat.cpp` (iostream + EH + setjmp feature
sweep) reports **8 passes / 0 failures** and `test/mame_cpptest.cpp` reports
**6 / 0** on the real machine (result records `0x0008` / `0x0006` on port
`0x2FE`, same harness as the C proofs); both also run on emu2. Purity gate
holds — INT 21h = 0, BDOS only.

The one thing plain C never needs is **global-constructor startup**. Watcom C++
registers each global object's constructor as a record in segment `XI` (its
destructor in `YI`); predefined `cout`/`cin`/`cerr` are constructed this way.
The minimal C `crt0` does not walk those tables, so the first `std::cout <<`
would dereference an unconstructed streambuf and crash. `port/crt0cpp.asm` is
the C `crt0` (heap seed + `__CommonInit` stdio attach) **extended** to bracket
`XIB/XI/XIE` + `YIB/YI/YIE` into `DGROUP` and run `__init_rtns`
(priority-ascending, before `main`) and `__fini_rtns` (priority-descending,
after `main`). Empty tables are a no-op, so it is safe for pure C too — but the
seven C targets keep the leaner `port/crt0sm.asm`; only `build-cpp.sh` uses
`crt0cpp.asm`.

The genuine C++ OS seams are small: `port/cpprt.c` supplies `__clib_malloc`/
`__clib_free` (the runtime's allocator hooks onto Watcom `nmalloc`/`nfree`), and
`port/ehsupp.c` supplies the exception/`longjmp` glue — a **near** `__longjmp_handler`
(a far one would `retf` against `longjmp`'s near call and unbalance the stack),
null `_get_ovl_stack`/`_restore_ovl_stack` (no overlays), and `__clib_exit`/
`__clib_fatal`. Everything else — `strupr` (aliased `strupr_=_strupr_` like
`strlwr` in the stream-I/O build), `ltoa`/`ultoa`, the buffered flush — is
genuine, unchanged Watcom clib.

## Toolchain

Uses the pre-built cross tools + clib source from the scratch OW tree
(override with `OW=`): `wcc.exe`, `wasm.exe`, `wlink.exe`; runs under `emu2`
(override with `EMU2=`). `wlink` must include the CP/M-86 paragraph-packing
fix (`f21f6a9f`).

## CPU-safety gate — 80186 (`assert_no_286`)

The RC759 CPU is an **80186**. Our own code is all built `-0` (8086), but the
transcendental/long-double math is pulled from Watcom's prebuilt **msdos.286**
mathlib (there is no msdos.086 mathlib build). The 80186 executes every
80186/80286 *real-mode integer* instruction, but **not** the 80286
system/protected-mode additions (`arpl`, `lar`, `lsl`, `lgdt`, `lidt`, `lldt`,
`sgdt`, `sidt`, `sldt`, `lmsw`, `smsw`, `clts`, `str`, `ltr`, `verr`, `verw`) —
those would fault on the target. So, as a **standing part of the CP/M-86 build
process going forward**, every build that makes a non-8086 (e.g. `.286`) library
object linkable disassembles it and **fails the build** (`assert_no_286`, exit 4)
if any such opcode appears. This complements `assert_no_8087` (which guards the
FPU): one gate guards the target's FPU, the other its CPU instruction set. See
`build-whetstone.sh` for the reference implementation.

## Milestones delivered

Tracked in ravn/rc7xx-work#6:

1. ~~**Near-heap bottom** — arena `__brk`/`sbrk` so Watcom `malloc`/`free`/
   `calloc`/`realloc` link and run.~~ **DONE** (`build-heap.sh`, run-verified).
2. ~~**stdio FILE\* write path** — override the DOS low-level primitives so the
   *full* buffered `stdio` FILE\* layer (`printf`/`fprintf`/`puts`/`fputs` →
   `__fprtf`/`fputc` → `__flush` → `__qwrite`) links and runs, beyond the
   direct-`__prtf` console `printf`.~~ **DONE for the console write-path**
   (`build-stdio.sh`, run-verified): `port/stdioshim.c` supplies `__qwrite`
   (BDOS `C_WRITE`) + `isatty`; Watcom's own DOS-free `__InitFiles` attaches the
   `FILE` buffers from the near-heap. The **disk** FILE\* path is now delivered
   too — see milestone 6.
3. ~~**stdcbench relink** — rebuild the existing `owc-drc/stdcbench` port against
   Watcom clib + this shim instead of the DR C runtime; gate on the
   c90base + c90lib score, cross-checked against the DR C reference (final
   score 13) as an independent correctness oracle.~~ **DONE**
   (`build-stdcbench.sh` + `run-stdcbench-mame.sh`, run-verified): the
   byte-identical upstream stdcbench 0.8 integer suite links against Watcom's
   own unchanged clib + our seams and runs end to end. On cycle-accurate MAME
   rc759, built with Watcom full optimisation (`-otexan`), it scores **c90base
   12 · c90lib 8 · final 20**, versus DR C's **8 · 5 · 13** on the identical
   machine — ~1.5× faster than the DR C runtime. Note: `c90base`/`c90lib`
   exercise **no floating point** (the `c90float`/`c90double` modules are
   upstream stubs), so this does **not** retire the `double` ABI seam — that
   remains for a float-exercising target.~~ *(the float seam is now retired —
   see milestone 4 below.)*
4. ~~**double soft-float** — prove Watcom's own `double` arithmetic runs on the
   no-8087 RC759.~~ **DONE** (`build-float.sh` + `test/floattest.c`,
   run-verified): compiled `-fpc`, the test's `volatile` operands force genuine
   runtime `call __FDA/__FDS/__FDM/__FDD` + `__FDI4` into Watcom's **unchanged**
   soft-float, which selects the pure-software `__FDxemu` branch because our
   `port/fpsoftstub.asm` sets `__real87 = 0`. **No 8087, no emulator, no
   interrupt-vector install, no INT 21h.** Purity gate green
   (`INT21h=0 · BDOS=2 · INT34-3D=0`), a tripwire asserts the `__FDx` calls are
   not constant-folded, and the output matches the hand-computed oracle
   `pi6=3141592 mul=40115 add=468 sub=242`. **8087 hardware support is
   intentionally NOT shipped** — left to a contributor with a real 8087; see
   [`docs/8087_HARDWARE_SUPPORT_DEFERRED.md`](docs/8087_HARDWARE_SUPPORT_DEFERRED.md).

5. ~~**transcendental libm + real `%e` float printf** — prove Watcom's own
   `sin`/`cos`/`atan`/`exp`/`log`/`sqrt` and its genuine `%e/%f/%g` float
   formatter run on the no-8087 RC759 by porting the **Whetstone** double
   benchmark.~~ **DONE** (`build-whetstone.sh` + `test/whetstone.c`,
   run-verified): compiled `-fpc`, Whetstone links Watcom's **unchanged**
   soft-float `__FDx` runtime, its transcendental library, and the real
   `_EFG_Format` (→ `__LDcvt`) float formatter — the latter installed at
   startup by `__CommonInit` (`port/cominit.c`, built `-DCOMMONINIT_EFG`), which
   `crt0` calls before `main` (our minimal crt0 does not walk the init table). The transcendentals + 80-bit long-double software
   layer are pulled from Watcom's prebuilt **msdos.286** mathlib (no msdos.086
   mathlib was ever built); those objects are software-float and INT-21h-free.
   All 10 per-module check values match, to the printed 4 significant digits,
   an **independent oracle** (the same `whetston.c` compiled and run with the
   host `cc -lm`, native IEEE-754 double). Purity gate green (`INT21h=0`,
   `BDOS>0`); a tripwire asserts the `__FDx` calls survive constant-folding
   (72 call sites). **New standing build gate:** `assert_no_286` disassembles
   every prebuilt library object made linkable from a non-8086 source and fails
   the build if any 80286-only (protected-mode) opcode appears — proving the
   RC759's 80186 can execute it. (One caveat left open below: the raw-byte
   `INT34-3D` emulator-trap scan is temporarily disabled — it false-positives
   on IEEE-double coefficient bytes in the libm constant tables; a
   disassembly-based code-vs-data replacement is a TODO.)

6. ~~**disk FILE\* path** — lift the console-only write seam to real CP/M-86
   disk files so Watcom's own `fopen`/`fclose`/`fwrite`/`fputs`/`fprintf`/
   `fread`/`fgets`/`fgetc`/`fseek`/`ftell`/`remove` link and run.~~ **DONE**
   (`build-diskio.sh` + `test/disktest.c`, run-verified): the single seam
   `port/diskio.c` supersedes `stdioshim.c` and supplies the five primitives
   `fopen` bottoms out into — `_sopen`/`__qread`/`__qwrite`/`__lseek`/`__close`
   — plus `lseek`/`_tell`/`remove`/`unlink`, all over CP/M-86 **FCB
   random-record BDOS** (`READ RANDOM` fn 33 / `WRITE RANDOM` fn 34): byte
   position is `record = pos>>7`, `offset = pos&127`, and an unwritten record
   reads back as EOF so a `Ctrl-Z` (0x1A) tail on the last partial record gives
   CP/M's text-EOF convention for free. `test/disktest.c` write-creates
   `TEST.TXT`, reads it back line-by-line, seeks by an `ftell`-captured offset,
   appends, re-counts, and `remove`s it — **511 self-checking `VERIFY`s,
   `DISKIO: PASS`, `INT21h=0 · BDOS=15`.** The stock `lseek`/`_tell` drag in the
   per-handle iomode table (`__GetIOMode`/`__handle_check`/`__NFiles`) this
   minimal seam omits, so `diskio.c` provides its own thin ones straight to
   `__lseek`. Watcom's own self-checking `bld/clibtest/streamio/c/iotest.c` (and
   `handleio`/`file`) is the eventual gold-standard oracle (as `float01–04` were
   for soft-float); it needs a few more primitives than a v1 round-trip
   (`tmpfile`/`tmpnam`/`fscanf`/`fopen("CON")`), documented as the next step.

7. ~~**C++ layer** — prove Watcom's own **iostreams**, **exception handling**
   and **`setjmp`/`longjmp`** run on the RC759, layered over the disk FILE\*
   seam.~~ **DONE** (`build-cpp.sh` + `test/cppfeat.cpp`/`test/mame_cpptest.cpp`,
   MAME rc759-verified: **8/0** and **6/0**). Reuses Watcom's genuine C++
   runtime (`plib*`/`plbx*` + `iost*`/`iosx*`) unchanged; the CP/M-86 seams are
   `port/cpprt.c` (`__clib_malloc`/`__clib_free` → Watcom `nmalloc`/`nfree`) and
   `port/ehsupp.c` (near `__longjmp_handler`, null overlay-stack hooks,
   `__clib_exit`/`__clib_fatal`). The one genuinely C++-specific piece is
   startup: predefined `cout`/`cin`/`cerr` are constructed via `XI`/`YI` global
   ctor/dtor records, which the minimal C `crt0` never walks, so
   `port/crt0cpp.asm` extends it with `__init_rtns`/`__fini_rtns` (empty tables
   = no-op, safe for pure C). This retargets the C++ layer that originally lived
   on a hand-written scratch mini-clib onto Open Watcom's own library
   (ravn/rc7xx-work#9, consolidated under #12).

## Next milestones (not yet done)

Still open (tracked in ravn/rc7xx-work#6). The full, honest gap/bug/limitation
list — including the byte-exact-length caveats below — lives in
[`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

- ~~**disk FILE\* path** (`open`/`close`/`read`/`lseek`) honouring the CP/M
  record model — 128-byte sectors, no exact byte length; text files use a
  Ctrl-Z (0x1A) terminator, binary files have none.~~ **DONE** — milestone 6
  (`build-diskio.sh`). Within-session `SEEK_END` is byte-exact; binary
  cross-reopen length and a write-side LRBC protocol for CCP/M-86 remain open
  (see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`).
- **Watcom's own `clibtest` stream-I/O suite as an independent disk oracle** —
  run `bld/clibtest/streamio/c/iotest.c` (and `handleio`/`file`) byte-for-byte
  unchanged, the way `build-owtests.sh` runs `float01–04`. Needs a few more
  seam primitives first: `tmpnam`/`tmpfile`, `fscanf` read path, and opening the
  console as a named file (`fopen("CON")`).
- ~~**`-fpc` float cross-check on cycle-accurate MAME rc759** — the authoritative
  no-8087 oracle; emu2 is green but may not faithfully model a no-8087 machine.
  Applies to both milestone 4 (`build-float.sh`) and milestone 5
  (`build-whetstone.sh`).~~ **DONE (2026-08-15)** — Whetstone (LOOP=10) run on
  real MAME rc759 (**i80186 @ 6.000 MHz**), screen output matched the host
  `cc -lm` oracle in `%12.4e` for all 10 check values. External timing via a
  side-effect-free I/O-port-0x2FE write-tap (`whet_time.lua`, START word 0xB000
  / END 0xE000 through `mame_done()` reading `emu.time()`): **72.45 emulated s
  ≈ 435 M cycles**. A companion fixed-point Mandelbrot (78×25, ≤30 iter) =
  **3.57 emulated s ≈ 21 M cycles**. Both are physically plausible for a 6 MHz
  80186 (Whetstone dominated by ~3500 software transcendentals through the
  80-bit long-double libm + ~1e5 64-bit `__FDx` ops; Mandelbrot ~⅓ integer-IMUL
  compute + ~⅔ BDOS console rendering). First real no-8087 performance data
  point (mame-tests: `whet-mame.sh`, `whet_time.lua`).
- **disassembly-based `INT34-3D` purity gate** (ravn/open-watcom-v2#15) — the
  current raw-byte scan false-positives on the IEEE-double coefficient tables
  that Watcom's libm (`exp`/`log`) embeds (a `CD 3B` byte inside a constant is
  data, not an `int 3Bh` instruction). It is temporarily disabled in
  `build-whetstone.sh`. Replace it with a code-vs-data disassembly check (like
  `assert_no_8087` / `assert_no_286`) that only counts real emulator-trap
  *instructions*.
- **8087 hardware paths** (`-fpi` trap-emulator via `port/emu87cpm.asm`,
  `-fpi87` real chip) — deferred to a contributor with 8087 hardware; design +
  verified findings in
  [`docs/8087_HARDWARE_SUPPORT_DEFERRED.md`](docs/8087_HARDWARE_SUPPORT_DEFERRED.md)
  and [`docs/FLOAT_8087_EMULATOR.md`](docs/FLOAT_8087_EMULATOR.md).
  Tracked as ravn/rc7xx-work#8.
