/* lowlevel.c -- CP/M-86 low-level OS seam for Open Watcom's retargeted clib.

   This is the thin bottom of the retarget: it replaces the ONE OS-coupled
   primitive that Watcom's genuine near-heap depends on -- the DOS __brk (in
   bld/clib/heap/c/sbrk.c, which grows DGROUP by calling INT 21h AH=4Ah
   TinySetBlock) -- with a pure in-DGROUP bump over a static arena. Everything
   above it (malloc / _nmalloc / free / _nfree / calloc / realloc / grownear's
   __ExpandDGROUP) is Watcom's UNCHANGED clib. No DOS trap is emitted.

   Why no OS call is needed: a CP/M-86 .CMD owns its TPA outright. The loader
   hands the program its whole memory region; there is no per-grow "resize my
   segment" syscall to make (unlike DOS, where AH=4Ah must extend the block).
   So growing the near heap is a pure pointer bump inside DGROUP, bounded by a
   static arena we reserve here.

   Worked example (the heap-test oracle): _nmalloc(40) with an empty heap
   (__nheapbeg == NULL, _curbrk == &wc_arena[0]) -> grownear.c __ExpandDGROUP
   computes new_brk = _amblksiz-rounded amount + _curbrk, calls __brk(new_brk);
   we return the OLD _curbrk (== &wc_arena[0]) as the address of the freshly
   exposed block and advance _curbrk. grownear links that block as the first
   miniheap; the 40-byte request is carved from it. */

#include <stddef.h>

/* _curbrk -- current top of the near heap, a DGROUP (near) offset. Normally
   defined in Watcom's crwd086.asm RT-data block; we define it here instead so
   the linker does NOT pull crwd086 (which also drags _psp / _LpCmdLine /
   _osmajor ... that a freestanding CP/M-86 .CMD neither has nor needs). The
   only heap module that touches it is grownear.c. Seeded by wc_heap_init()
   from crt0 before the first allocation. */
unsigned _curbrk = 0;

/* The near-heap arena: a plain uninitialised static array, so it lands in _BSS
   (reserved at load, NOT stored in the .CMD image -- no file bloat) inside
   DGROUP. Watcom links heap blocks by DGROUP-near pointers, so an in-DGROUP
   array is exactly the right backing store. 20 KB is well above stdcbench's
   ~1.5 KB measured high-water mark, with margin for the c90lib hash tables. */

   grownear.c reads _curbrk (new_brk = amount + _curbrk) BEFORE it calls
   __brk(); a zero _curbrk would make new_brk a raw size, not an address.
   Called from crt0sm.asm (wc_heap_init_) ahead of main.

   Also shrink _amblksiz (Watcom's heap-grab granularity, default 4-8 KB) to
   one paragraph. grownear.c rounds every miniheap grab UP to _amblksiz; with
   the default 8 KB, UnZip's single 32 KB request (the zcalloc(8192,4) inflate
   window / STORED copy buffer) rounds to 40 KB and overruns our ~35 KB arena,
   so the alloc fails. A 16-byte granularity keeps the roundup waste negligible
   so the 32 KB window fits alongside the I/O and CRC buffers in the arena. */

   only behavioural change vs. DOS is the OS call: we bump within wc_arena and
   fail past its end, instead of asking DOS to resize the program's block. */
