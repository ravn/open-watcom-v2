"""Independent CP/M-86 .CMD runner using Unicorn Engine (QEMU's CPU core).

Unlike cpm86run.py (my own hand-written 8086 decoder), here the actual 8086
instruction execution is done by Unicorn/QEMU -- code I did not write -- so a
correct result is independent confirmation that the .CMD's machine code and
entry point are right. Only the CP/M-86 BDOS layer (INT 0E0h) is emulated by
hooking the interrupt.

This is a CPU + BDOS harness, not a full CP/M-86 machine: Unicorn provides the
instruction set (incl. 80186+), and this file emulates the BDOS system calls a
program makes. The console/string group is implemented, plus S_BDOSVER (12) and
the Concurrent CP/M-86 date/time calls T_SET (104) / T_GET (105) / T_SECONDS
(155) -- so a stock DATE.CMD prints the correct date and self-timing programs
(e.g. stdcbench) get advancing seconds. The RC759 XIOS Int 28h fn 19 "16 ms
counter" is deliberately NOT emulated (the real machine's XIOS does not maintain
it). All of this is a superset of plain CP/M-86, so ordinary CP/M-86 programs
keep working. Every other function (disk/file, and the rest of the Concurrent
CP/M / XIOS API) raises a clear "unimplemented BDOS function" error, so
unsupported programs fail loudly instead of silently.

Program load emulates the CCP: the memory model (8080 / small) is read from the
.CMD group descriptors, groups are placed in memory, segment registers and the
entry IP are set per the System Guide (8080 -> CS:0100H, small -> CS:0000H),
and the base page (group descriptors, default FCBs at 005CH/006CH, command tail
at 0080H) is populated from the command line via the ccp module.

# add T_GET (BDOS 105) "get date and time".  We report a BDOS version of 3.1
# from S_BDOSVER (BDOS 12) so date/time-aware programs know T_GET is available,
# while staying backward compatible: the value is still >= 2.2, so plain

# The emulator has no hardware clock, so T_GET's base date/time is the host's
# real wall clock at the moment the program starts (so a stock DATE.CMD prints
# the correct current date), and it then advances by a deterministic virtual
# clock: the number of code bytes executed so far (counted by a block hook),
# divided by CLOCK_HZ, gives the emulated elapsed seconds added on top.  The
# absolute time therefore tracks reality, while elapsed *differences* -- all a
# benchmark's "while(clock()-start<N)" loop actually uses -- stay host
# independent and reproducible, proportional to the work the emulated 8086 does.
# Set CPM86_EPOCH (e.g. "2024-01-01T00:00:00") to pin the base for a fully
# deterministic absolute clock; tune the rate via CPM86_CLOCK_HZ.

# The RC759 Piccoline runs an Intel 80186 (6-8 MHz), but its three on-chip
# 80186 timers are wired to sound/cassette, not timekeeping (PICCOLINE
# Programmer's Guide sec. 2.3).  The PICCOLINE Guide (App. A, fn 19) documents an
# XIOS "16 ms counter" read via Int 28h function 19, but on the real Concurrent
# CP/M-86 turnkey disk that XIOS does NOT maintain the counter (verified: it
# never advances, so stdcbench's timed loop hung).  So we do NOT model fn 19.
# Program-visible time that DOES advance comes from the ordinary BDOS clock:
# T_GET (fn 105, date + minute) and T_SECONDS (fn 155, date + seconds) -- the
# latter is what self-timing programs (stdcbench's portme.c) use for elapsed
# time on real hardware, at one-second resolution.  Both are driven here by the
# deterministic code-byte virtual clock (seconds = ticks/CLOCK_HZ), so elapsed
# *differences* stay host independent and reproducible.  CPM86_TICK_MS only
# affects the optional 16 ms diagnostic print below, not any guest-visible time.
