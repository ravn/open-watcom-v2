* Description:  Routines for creation of CP/M-86 .CMD command files.
*
*   A .CMD file is a 128-byte header followed by group images.  The header is
*   up to eight 9-byte group descriptors:
*       db type   (1=CODE, 2=DATA, 3=EXTRA, 4=STACK, 9=pure code)
*       dw length (paragraphs of stored image)
*       dw base   (load paragraph; 0 => relocated by the loader)
*       dw min    (paragraphs to allocate, incl. BSS)
*       dw max    (maximum paragraphs to allocate)
*   Group images are packed at PARAGRAPH (16-byte) granularity: each group's
*   stored image is padded to a paragraph so its byte length matches the
*   paragraph "length" field in its descriptor, and the loader finds the next
*   group at base + length*16.  (Genuine DRI .CMD files pack this way; padding
*   an image to a 128-byte record while declaring only its paragraph length
*   left every following group's data at an offset the loader never read.)
*   Phase 1 emits
*   base=0 relocatable images with no fixup table (header 0x7F bit 7 clear),
*   which covers the small (CODE+DATA) and 8080 (single group) models.
